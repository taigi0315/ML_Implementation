# Descretization_R
Descretization functions using R(Equal width, Equal frequency, IEM)

Descretization is used for classification algorithm  <br>
one of easiest(naive) way is equal width/frequency  <br>
IEM is implemented after reviewing "Multi-Interval Discretization ofContinuous-Valued by Usama M.Fayyad"              <br>

All code is written by Changik Choi.           <br>
there can be many mistake or better way to do. <br>
